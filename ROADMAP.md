# 🚀 Jarvis Finance System Roadmap

## ✅ **COMPLETED LEVELS**

### **Level 1: Basic Receipt Detection** ✅
- Email monitoring every 15 minutes
- 23 known vendor detection (Amazon, Uber, PayPal, Swiss retailers, etc.)
- Pattern recognition for receipt/invoice subject lines
- Automatic PDF attachment download
- Telegram notifications for detected receipts

### **Level 2: Smart AI Processing** ✅ 
- AI email classification with confidence scoring
- GPT-4 PDF text extraction and transaction parsing
- Automatic transaction creation for high-confidence receipts (≥60%)
- Quality validation and error handling
- Enhanced Telegram notifications with AI results
- Smart routing: Auto-process vs Manual review vs Skip

### **Level 2.5: Manual Receipt Processing** ✅
- Natural language interface via Jarvis for processing existing receipt files
- `process_receipt_file` action integrated into AI schema
- Support for PDF, JPG, PNG, HEIC files at specific file paths
- Same AI pipeline as email processing with confidence scoring
- API endpoint `/api/process-receipt` for programmatic access
- Commands like: "process receipt file at uploads/receipt.pdf"

## 🎯 **PLANNED LEVELS**

### **Level 3: Enhanced Manual Review**

#### **Manual Review Flow Options**

##### **🎯 When Manual Review is Triggered**
- Medium confidence (60-69%): AI detected receipt but not 100% sure
- Low confidence (< 60%): Data extraction uncertain  
- Missing data: No PDF attachments or extraction failed
- Validation failures: Invalid amounts, dates, or shop names

##### **🔄 Current Flow (Level 2)**
```
📧 Email → 🤖 AI (65% confidence) → ⚠️ Manual Review → 📱 Telegram notification
```

##### **🚀 Enhanced Options**

**Option A: Telegram Approval Buttons**
```markdown
📧 Receipt needs review (ID: email-123)

🏪 Amazon - $127.45 USD
📦 iPhone Case, Screen Protector
📅 2025-06-18

[✅ Approve] [✏️ Edit] [❌ Ignore]
```

**Option B: Web Review Dashboard**
- `/review` - Queue of pending receipts
- Thumbnail previews of PDFs  
- Quick approve/edit/reject buttons
- Batch processing capability

**Option C: Smart Suggestions**
```markdown
👀 **Manual Review Required**

🤖 **AI Suggestion:**
🏪 Shop: Amazon (confidence: 65%)
💵 Amount: $127.45 (confidence: 90%) 
📅 Date: 2025-06-18 (confidence: 95%)

📝 **What needs review:**
• Shop name unclear (Amazon vs Amazon.com?)
• Multiple items detected but amounts don't add up
